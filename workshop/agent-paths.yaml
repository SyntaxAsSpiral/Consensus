# Path expansion rules:
# - ~ expands to user home directory
# - Paths ending with / are directories
# - agent_file is the global/user-level output file for agent recipes
# - project_agent_file is the filename used in project directories (~/path/to/project/{filename})
# - skills is the base directory for skill installations
# 
# Project-specific agent files:
# - Claude Code & Cursor use CLAUDE.md in project root
# - All others use AGENTS.md in project root
